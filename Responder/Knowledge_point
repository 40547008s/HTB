Web application vulnerability of NTLM

use scan command : sudo nmap -sS -sV target_ip -p- --min-rate 5000 -vv

use the brower to link the target_ip than it will redirected to another url

if we can`t see the web, it represent that it wasn`t found in DNS, so we need to add it by manual edit file (pwd: /ect/hosts) with target_ip hostname

when you change the language of the web, it will use .php to generate webpage.

web use "page" to load different variable. #it could be a vulnerability!!

you can use "page=variable" to explore server file (LFI vulnerability)!

also you can use it to get the sever info by send request to remote host (RFI)!

NTLM : New Technology LAN Manager

use Responder tool command : responder -I tun0 #To listen the NIC message
use john the ripper tool   : john NTLM_hash
use evil-winrm to connect  : evil-winrm -i target_ip -u Account -p password
Last surf the server to explore the flag!!
